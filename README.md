How to automate downloading mp3 files from google translate?

2 steps (fist step is not necessary, depends on your language)

1: get your words into a txt file (each word on a new line) and use SOT-Selenium (It's possible that not all files will download without this step), be sure to have your Chrome webdriver ready (if you don't have Chrome webdriver just google it)

2: download files using SOT-Downloader (first file will have "-" in the beginning, i'm too lazy to debug, it has to do with 'rb' parameter)
